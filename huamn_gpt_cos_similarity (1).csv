8,8,8,8,8,"EDIT , Nov 21 : By popular demand , now includes Midrange decks and Limited formats . Also , a new section on where players get their cards . Magic : The Gathering is a collectable card game . It can be played in several different formats , but in the most common , two players create decks out of the cards they own and play against each other . Generally , the cards in a deck are either lands or spells . Lands provide the energy needed to cast spells , and spells usually do one of the following : - Summon a creature that can fight for you or an artifact that you can use . ( * * Creatures * * and * * Artifacts * * ) - Create a lasting effect that affects the game as a whole or one or more cards in play . ( * * Enchantments * * ) - Create an instantaneous effect that affects one or more cards in play or an effect that lasts a single turn . ( * * Sorceries * * and * * Instants * * ) - Summon a sort of "" teammate "" that has its own abilities . ( * * Planeswalkers * * ) The primary goal is to run your opponent out of life points by attacking him with creatures or damaging him directly with spells . There are other ways to win , such as running your opponent out of cards in his deck . The gameplay is complex . The players take turns , but many types of spells can be cast on an opponent 's turn , or in response to a spell that they are trying to cast . A critical play by one player may be countered by the other , and that counter itself countered by the first . There are many thousands of cards out there , and you are not expected to know about them all . The Comprehensive Rules ( * not * including the text of cards ) are nearly two hundred pages , although a lot of that consists of old mechanics that are rarely used or highly - specified details that are rarely relevant . The learning curve is pretty steep , but a few games suffice to learn the basic rules . The complexity is more similar to Dungeons and Dragons than to most card games . A key feature of M : tG is the concept of * * color * * . There are five colors : Red , Green , White , Blue , Black . Each is "" allied "" to two others and "" opposed "" to the two others . Most spells require mana of a certain color to cast , which is produced by different types of land cards . Each color has distinct strengths and weaknesses – for example , blue has the best counterspells , but it 's not very good at simply hitting things . A given deck will usually use from one to three colors of card , although in some situations decks with four or five colors can work . In addition , it is often considered that there are three general archetypes of deck ( with a * lot * of variation within each category ) : - * * Aggro * * decks focus on dealing damage ASAP to win ASAP . They usually have cheap creatures ( "" weenies "" ) that can be used right away and "" buff""-type spells to eke out a few more points of damage . They usually win fast or not at all , because they often ca n't stand up to the more powerful creatures and spells that are played later in the game . - * * Control * * decks focus on preventing the opponent from acting until the player is ready to win with powerful spells or abilities . They run a lot of counterspells , destruction spells , and things that make action more expensive for the opponent , along with a few creatures strong on defense and disruption . They usually win by using cheap defenses against expensive attacks until they are ready to overwhelm the opponent with their accumulated strength , and lose if they just ca n't stay ahead of the enemy 's attacks . - * * Combo * * decks rely on a few combinations of cards that can lead to a near - instant victory . There * are * infinite combos in M : tG , but they 're designed to be difficult or resource - intensive to pull off . A combo deck will usually run ( in addition to the all - important combo pieces ) "" tutor "" cards that let them search their deck , protection cards to guard the combo pieces , and just enough stall cards to prevent a quick defeat . A combo deck wins when it gets its combo in place before losing , and loses if it ca n't get the combo out in time or ca n't protect it long enough to use it . - * * Midrange * * decks are a common intermediate archetype between Aggro and Control . Midrange tries to beat down the opponent with damage from powerful creatures ( colloquially , "" fatties "" ) rather than with cheap ones ( "" weenies "" ) . These decks have to run enough control to stay alive until the big hitters come out . They win when they get the hitters out early enough to do lethal damage , and lose when they ca n't get the big guys out at all ( being out - controlled ) or when they just take too much of a beating too early ( being out - aggro'd ) . --- Many different kinds of people play M : tG. There are professional players who win large sums at tournaments , groups of friends who play casually on the weekends , and everything in between . If you 're playing competitively , it can be absurdly expensive , as you can not compromise on getting the perfect cards for your deck , but if you and your opponents are playing casually , it 's a lot cheaper . The most common formats are as follows . Two - player games are the norm for tournaments , but casual matches are often multiplayer . * * Constructed * * formats call for pre - constructed decks built from each player 's personal collection : - * * Standard * * : Decks are made of cards printed in about the last 18 months . - * * Modern * * : Decks are made of cards printed since about 2003 ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Legacy * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) . - * * Vintage * * : Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a * very small * ban list ) . - * * Commander * * ( or "" EDH "" ): Decks are made of * any * cards ( minus a ban list ) , but limited to one of each card . One creature card is designated as your "" commander "" and is nearly always available for summoning . A popular multiplayer format . * * Limited * * formats feature decks made on the spot from a limited pool of cards : - * * Sealed * * : Each player opens several randomized booster packs and makes a deck from the contents . - * * Draft * * : A group of players open many packs and use a system to pick their cards from the contents , then build a deck from what they have . These formats cost money each time to play , because you need to buy booster packs . However , you can play them without having any of your own cards beforehand . Limited play can be a good way to pick up more cards . A relatively new casual format is * * Cube * * , in which you and your group put together a large pile of cards beforehand and use them in place of booster packs . This eliminates the recurring expense , although you need to have enough cards beforehand . There are others formats , including Conspiracy , Planechase , Pauper ( use no rare cards ) . Two - Headed Giant ( play with a partner ) , and many more . Formats that allow older cards tend to be more expensive , because the cards have been out of print for a long time . Commander is a bit cheaper than other formats that allow old cards , because you only can have one of each card ( other formats usually allow up to four of each card ) . I play Commander with my D & D group . None of us puts that much money into it , and we try to keep it more fun than competitive . Some of the players also play in local mini - tournaments on Friday nights ( "" Friday Night Magic "" ) , usually breaking about even . --- So , where does one get cards ? Most cards come from randomized booster packs with 15 cards each . Cards from a given set are designated either common , uncommon , rare , or "" mythic rare "" . You can buy booster packs for around $ 3.50 USD from retailers , or you can buy them as part of a limited tournament . There are also pre - made decks that you can buy directly from Wizards of the Coast . Each one has a theme and cards intended to work together . You wo n't win any tournaments with a pre - made deck , but it can be a good starting point . In addition , there are a couple of products intended for beginners , such as the "" Deck - builder 's toolkit "" with a semi - randomized selection of cards and a big stack of common lands . ( Common lands are dirt cheap , but it would take quite a few booster packs to get enough to build a deck . ) Most M : tG players trade cards with their friends or at events to get the specific cards they need . In addition , there is a thriving market of single cards at game stores and online . Some very , very old cards are very , very rare and expensive . A single [ Black Lotus ] ( URL_0 ) can cost many thousands of dollars . But these cards are not legal in most formats , and most players will never have seen one in person . When playing casually , your group may allow the use of "" proxy "" cards to substitute for the pricey ones . Myself , I 've only been playing for a year or so , and I do n't actually own my own cards ! ( My friends have a ton of extra decks to lend out . ) I 'm planning to build my own Commander deck soon , and I 'll be starting from a pre - made deck from Wizards and supplementing it primarily with trades with friends and singles from the internet .","Magic: The Gathering is a collectable card game that can be played in several different formats, but in the most common two players create decks out of the cards they own, usually lands or spells, to run their opponent out of life points.

29,29,29,29,29,"The news article you posted does n't do a great deal of explaining , but the [ published paper ] ( URL_0 ;) is quite useful . Particularly , the attack summarised through the following steps : 1 ) Client downloads a file from the server that colludes with the adversary . 2 ) While the download progresses , the server injects a repeating traffic pattern in the TCP connection it sees originating from the exit node . 3 ) After sometime the download process is stopped and the server halts the traffic shaping procedure . 4 ) The adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server to exit traffic and for the various clients that used the victim entry node for the duration of the attack experiment . 5 ) If the flows are not correctly aligned , equally long and evenly separated , then the adversary applies the approximation strategy to correctly align them . 6 ) The adversary thereafter computes correlation coefficient for the server to exit traffic network statistics and for all the individual clients that used the victim entry node during the attack experiment . 7 ) The victim client ’s statistics is expected to be most correlated to the server to exit node traffic . Thus the client , whose traffic statistics are most correlated to the exit node traffic are chosen as the victim and verified . Basically , if the NSA controlled a service you were trying to access via Tor , they could send specially shaped packets to act as a sort of label . Even though the data is encrypted and anonymised through Tor ( between the entry and exit nodes ) , if the NSA controlled a lot of routers or major Internet exchange points , they could still track the special packets from the server to the first exit - node , through the middlemen , and finally ( and imperatively ) back through the original entry node & back to your original connection . But that 's not nearly ELI5 enough so I 'll do a * really simplified * analogy which gets the idea across : * * TL;DR * * - say Tor was n't actually an Internet thing and instead was a way of anonymously sending physical mail . If the sender of the parcel was malicious ( eg , an NSA controlled honeypot site ) they could send out really heavy parcels instead of normal , small , letters . So even if the parcel gets repackaged in different boxes or wrapping paper with new labels on ( the middlemen trying to anonymise the post ) , at the end of the day , the client is still going to be receiving a really heavy ass parcel . Even though it may look different , the weight of the packet indicates it 's the same packet which the NSA sent out . Which , in and of itself is pretty useless . But if the NSA controlled most of the postmen , they can just ask them if anyone got a really heavy parcel delivered that day . If they 're lucky , one of the postmen they control remembers delivering a super heavy parcel to 23 Jump Road , Michigan , USA . And then you 're fucked . But critically this relies on two things : having control of the end server , and being able to monitor major Internet exchange points in near real - time , and we 're talking hundreds if not thousands of gigabytes per second here . Theoretically yes Tor is vulnerable but this paper does n't prove it can actually be exploited in any meaningful manner to intercept communications between two end users that want to remain anonymous .","The news article you posted may not explain much about how the attack works, but the published paper (URL_0;) provides a clear explanation: when a client downloads a file from a server controlled by the adversary, the server injects a repeating traffic pattern into the TCP connection from the exit node, and in order to identify the client, the adversary obtains network statistics from flow records corresponding to the server-exit traffic, applies an approximation strategy to correctly align the flows and computes correlation coefficient for the server-exit traffic network statistics.

At those junctions , bunches of nerves coming from nearby all gather together on the way to the brain At each gate , the signals from all the bundled nerves are processed together . Sometimes , two nerves work together to increase each other 's intensity , and sometimes , they dampen each other 's signals . At the same time , nerves coming from the brain work as ' central control ' to change the intensity of the signal that 's being passed on . Again , sometimes the signal is increased , and sometimes it 's decreased . Over the history of their development , our brains have gotten good at learning what signals they should pay attention to , and what signals they can ignore . One of the signals the brain has learned to ' ignore ' is self touch . It is n't dangerous , and we usually only need to be partially aware of it . Walking through a spider web and touching your hand to your face are two different experiences , and for good reason . When the brain identifies self - touch , it uses those feedback fibers I mentioned before to suppress the intensity of sensation , which makes it easier to ignore . Also , when a signal arrives in the brain , several regions cooperate to figure out exactly what it is , where it came from , and what to do about it . When we identify self - touch , there are regions of our brain that are trained to say ' ignore it ' . As a result , we suppress the intensity of those signals .","When we touch any part of our body, nerves in the skin are activated and travel to the brain, gathering at several junctions or 'gates' along the way.

93,93,93,93,93,"I think it goes without saying that government is n't really anything like personal debt but it might help put things in perspective using a more familiar idea we can grasp . Part of the problem with the perception of our debt being a big problem is that the numbers are big . Mind bogglingly big . Scary big . Our debt is roughly $ 17,000,000,000,000 . And , yes , that is a big number . But let me show you another number : $ 17,000,000,000,000 . Why , yes . That is the same number . $ 17,000,000,000,000 also happens to be our Gross Domestic Product or GDP , which is what our country produces in a year . Think of the GDP as our annual salary as a country . Now if you met a person who made $ 170,000 a year ( a much easier number to get your head around ) and that person was in debt to the tune of $ 170,000 say with a house a couple of credit cards and that person always paid all of his bills all the time , most people would say that person has very good credit and is n't at risk of going bankrupt and would likely be a particularly good candidate if they decided to get another loan . And so long as their income grows proportionally with their debt and they keep paying their bills , they 'll continue to be a safe bet to continue to receive loans . In other words , if their debt rose to $ 200,000 , that 'd be okay if their income was also in the neighborhood of $ 200,000 . Now what you want to know is : Can the debt ever be repaid ? And the simple answer is , "" yes , but you would n't really want to "" . Keeping our house metaphor in tact for the time being , if we wanted to get out of debt , we could pay less for the stuff we use and use the difference to pay down our debt . But there 's a problem : What do we cut ? Food ? Medicine ? Clothing ? Home Security ? Everything we 're spending money on we more or less need . Sure , we could nibble around the edges and find a few dollars here and there , but not enough to make a really big difference . Going back to our full scale US debt , it sounds good to say you 're going to cut our $ 10 million budget for ketchup research or $ 6 million in pork for a courthouse in Milwaukee , but that 's like saying you 're going to pay off your mortgage by rummaging around for spare change in your couch . When trillions are on the table , millions wo n't cut it and billions will barely touch it . Which is n't to say it 's impossible . Just about 20 years ago the Clinton administration had a plan to pay down the national debt by raising taxes and cutting spending . According to that plan , we would have paid off the national debt by the far off future year of 2011 . Unfortunately , when we went to war in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2002 and 2003 , that added expense sidelined the debt repayment and ballooned our debt . And then in 2008 and 2009 the financial crisis happened and various stimulus packages and tax relief packages meant our debt ballooned again . It 's really been a lousy decade for debt and deficit . But have no fear : Should we do the obvious yet politically suicidal thing of raising taxes and cutting spending we can get our debt under control again ( until the next big crisis , at least ) . But we do n't want to pay it off , mostly because a lot of our debt is n't owned by foreign countries : it 's owned by people like you and me in the form of government bonds . ( Basically you buy XX in IOUs from the government and they 'll pay you back XX plus interest after a given amount of time and these are generally seen as safe but low(er ) return parts of many investment portfolios for individuals and businesses . ) If the government is debt free , that means there are no bonds to invest in , which is n't very good for the economy . Economists might disagree on how much debt is good and how much is bad but most would agree that it 's best to have some . So that it . Our debt is big , but it 's not concerning because it 's about the same size as our GDP . It should probably be at least a little smaller , which is simple and hard because everyone knows what needs to be done ( higher taxes and lower spending ) but nobody is willing to do it . But much like needing to lose weight you ca n't just exercise more OR cut calories , you 've got to do both . And while we could one day , 20 , 30 years from now slowly get to zero with modest cuts and tax hikes , we do n't really need to or want to because it would mean lower , slower economic growth as a nation and fewer quality investment opportunities for individuals and businesses .","It might help to put things in perspective by comparing government debt to a more relatable concept – personal debt. Our national debt is an enormous number, $17,000,000,000,000, which is also equal to our Gross Domestic Product or GDP, which is what our country produces in a year – our annual salary as a country. Imagine a person who earns $170,000 and has $170,000 of debt, but always pays their bills. Their debt isn't a problem, so long as their income grows with it and they keep paying. So, can the national debt ever be repaid? Yes, but it would be an economically unwise move – we'd have to cut spending and raise taxes, which would slow down our growth as a nation and reduce investment opportunities for individuals and businesses. While it's possible to slowly get to zero, it's not necessary or desirable.",3.3782591819763184

It costs fractions of a penny to digitize the final product and distribute it on the internet , you 'd think that would drop the price .

So here you have a market who wants your product and wants it now , and ca n't or wo n't afford it . I 'm not saying it 's ok , but this is the catalyst that allows people to justify it .

170,170,170,70,170,"tl;dr : GIF is an image compression format , which is n't really suited well to compressing video data . Basically the only advantage is that browsers support the format natively without loading plugins . Actual videos compressed with video encoders are way more efficient . --- In an animated GIF , each frame of the animation is encoded as a separate file , and then the files are more or less just stuck together in the final animation . You can do something similar with JPEG ( Motion JPEG ) , although it 's not supported by browsers in quite the same way as GIFs . Also GIFs do a better job of compressing line art rather than photographs . Thus , making a video out of GIF images yields pretty poor compression anyhow . In an encoded video file , the video compressor takes into account that successive frames are ( probably ) related to each other . The first frame is encoded completely , in a similar ( but more advanced ) method as a JPEG might be . However , the next frame is typically encoded as just the difference from the first frame to the second . This is way more efficient for most videos where motion happens slowly . Say the video is of a ball falling . In an animated GIF , each frame is a standalone , complete picture of the ball and any surroundings . It 's compressed rather poorly , and a lot of redundant information is sent , so each individual frame is very large . In a video encoded with a video codec ( MPEG1 , MPEG2 , MPEG4 , h.264 , h,265 , etc ) , the first frame is compressed somewhat similarly to a JPEG . Then the second frame basically says "" see the region of the first frame where the ball is ? Move that down a bit . Fill in the background with this information . "" - This frame is * way * smaller and easier to transmit than the first frame . It 's also easier and faster to decode . There are some drawbacks to the video compression approach , but in general it does a way better job of representing the video data with way fewer bits . --- EDIT : Wow , this is getting a lot of attention :) I left out a lot of stuff to keep the answer simple , but I 'm getting pinged about a lot of the same things over and over , so here 's a few quick additions : - Yes , compression algorithm differences matter as well . I said something to this effect , but to extend : GIF uses a compression method that works well for color patterns , and video encoders use something that works better for photographs / live video . I did n't try to explain DCT / Quantization / entropy coding since that 's a super technical topic for ELI5 . - Yes , GIF can represent a simple delta between two frames . However , in the case of video data , it is rare that this is useful . Someone asked for a more detailed explanation of this , [ my response is here ] ( URL_1 ) . - Yes , there may be other factors at work besides the bitrate / coding issues .

There 's a lot of back - and - forth , legal issues , competitors refusing to agree and so forth that is really hampering the HTML5 video tag . [ Wikipedia has a long article on the subject . ] ( URL_2 ) We 've had better video technology than GIF for years and GIF is still going strong . I think we 're stuck with it , despite it being a terrible technology for the problem . ( See also : practically every other technology used on the web ) - A common question is "" So does this mean that simpler videos with less movement will be encoded to smaller file sizes ? Or that complex or really random videos make larger or less efficient video files ? "" The answer to this somewhat depends on the encoder settings , but in general the answer is yes . If you encode a simple video with little motion it will take less data than a more complex video with a lot of motion and random stuff going on . Modern video encoders are tuned towards encoding video sequences from cameras . They make assumptions based on what the real world looks like most of the time , and use those assumptions to compress more efficiently . They also take into account what our eyes are good at seeing .","Animated GIFs are an image compression format, which is not well suited to compressing video data.

177,177,177,77,177,"Key Existential Concepts The meaninglessness of life , the absence of God , the loneliness of being a thinking individual — it sounds like the existentialists were n't the happiest group of folks , right ? Not necessarily true . Read on to get an idea of what existentialism is all about . Absurdity : What human beings encounter when they come into contact with the world . Absurdity is brought about because the human instinct to seek order and meaning is frustrated by the refusal of the world to be orderly or meaningful . Anxiety : Kierkegaard said , "" Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom . "" You feel anxiety because you recognize that you and you alone are responsible for your actions . This produces the two - sided feeling of simultaneous dread and exhilaration . Alienation : The sense that you 're a stranger in the world , or a stranger to yourself . Many aspects of existence can be alienating . One of the primary sources is absurdity . Ironically , the stories and systems developed by philosophy and religion to address that absurdity can be just as alienating . Existence precedes essence : Sartre 's phrase to describe the existential situation humans find themselves in . It refers to the fact that when you 're born , you have no meaning , no purpose , no definition . Human beings exist first , and only later define themselves . The Übermensch : The word Nietzsche uses to refer to his ideal human being . Literally "" overman , "" the word reflects the importance in his philosophy of overcoming — overcoming traditional values , overcoming the herd mentality , and , most importantly , overcoming yourself . You overcome these things so that you might attain something greater . Nietzsche 's Übermensch is an unconventional creator of values , a joyous free spirit , and one who embraces the earth instead of pining away for heaven . The death of God : The death of the notion that belief in God alone , or belief in any religious or philosophical system , is sufficient to provide human beings with the meaning , purpose , and definition they crave . It 's the recognition that , because no external system can provide you with the answers , you must take responsibility for providing them yourself . Subjectivity : Your first - person perspective on the world , including the needs , desires , and emotions that accompany that perspective . The existentialists take this as a valid and important starting point for genuinely human endeavors . This can be contrasted with the scientific mindset , which always starts with objectivity — seeing people in impersonal , objective terms without emotion or appreciation for their individual point of view .","Existentialism, which embraces concepts such as the meaninglessness of life, absence of God and the loneliness of being a thinking individual, often sounds like a pessimistic world view, however, it is much more than that. Existentialists recognize absurdities in the world that one has to cope with, which can lead to feelings of alienation, but also recognises the subjective human perspective and the responsibility of the individual to create their own meaning and purpose in life. This includes Nietzsche’s Übermensch (“overman”) that seeks to overcome the herd mentality and ultimately “attain something greater”, as well as Sartre’s existence that precedes essence and the death of God, reinforcing the recognition that no external system can provide humans with the answers and that one must take responsibility for providing it for themselves.",3.5290632247924805

So instead of you buying that stock , lets say your grandfather bought it at $ 10,000 and when he died it was worth $ 25,000 , and when you finally sold it you got $ 30,000 for it .

201,201,201,101,201,"There are some simple rules for calculating with db . The easiest one to remember is that multiplying something by a numbers adds something to the db value . Multiplying with 10 adds exactly 10 db . So you would hear all the people talking at 30 db . Another rule that is handy to now is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db . That means 2 people would make 23 db noise , 4 people 26 db and 8 people 29 db . In addition to that you can split larger numbers up for example multiplying by 80 ( for example 80 talking people ) would be 8 * 10 which is 2 * 2 * 2 * 10 and with the mentioned rules you get 3 + 3 + 3 + 10 = 19db more . But that 's just a theoretical value that would work if all the sound happens at the same place . People are usually not just standing inside each other that 's why you 'd end up with slightly different numbers if your standing in the middle of the 10 people or right next besides them .

Another rule that comes in handy is that multiplying by 2 adds about 3 db, so for example 2 people would make 23 db and 8 people 29 db noise. Additionally, larger numbers can be split up, for example multiplying by 80 (80 talking people) would be 8 x 10 which is 2 x 2 x 2 x 10 and yields a 3 + 3 + 3 +10 = 19db increase.

354,354,354,254,354,"There are five reasons why animals have two eyes ( rather than one ): 1 . Better depth perception . The image on the two eyes is slightly different and by comparing the locations of the images , an animal can locate objects in depth . It is not the only depth cue but it is an important one for predator or tree dwelling species . 2 . Wider field of view . The animal can see more of the visual world with two eyes than with one . 3 . Each eye has a blind spot , and each eye covers the blind spot of the other . There is a blindspot in each eye where the optic nerve leaves the eye , and in that region of the eye , there are no photoreceptors so you are blind there . However , the other eye covers that region so you still know what is there . 4 . Easier to see dim lights with two eyes than one . Two eyes both catching light particles will have a lower threshold for detecting dim lights than just one eye . 5 . Most importantly : as a spare ! An animal still has a good chance of surviving with one eye , but very little chance of reproducing with none . Now , why do n't we have MORE than two eyes ? Likely because , in mammals , the number of new nerve cells that would have to be supported by an additional eye would not be worth the benefits of having it . Nerve cells are the hungriest cells in the body , and more of the cerebral cortex is devoted to vision than any other function . Having additional eyes ( beyond two ) in mammals would require huge numbers of new nerve cells to support them , and the metabolic cost would not be worth the benefit .","Animals have two eyes rather than one for a multitude of reasons; better depth perception due to the difference in images shown in each eye, a wider field of view, covering the blind spots of each eye, the easier detection of dim lights, most importantly as a spare, and aside from the large number of nerve cells required to support it, the metabolic cost for additional eyes likely outweighs the benefit in mammals.",3.7802066802978516

I would n't necessarily call it wrong , but too simplistic . There are algorithms called "" genetic algorithms . "" The key of these algorithms is that a data stream that is exactly analogous to DNA dictates the behavior of the system , while the algorithm is static and controls mutation , breeding , and fitness . These equations can be used for just about anything . You can literally breed more fuel efficient engines , more aerodynamic cars and planes , you can teach robots to do their job , virtual creatures to walk , or survive in their virtual environments ; these algorithms do make their way into physical robots in industrial production and research labs . The DNA data can be arbitrarily long and represent arbitrarily complicated behavior . To some degree , complexity can be so high that humans basically ca n't explain how it 's working . One famous demonstration used genetic algorithms to configure a programmable processor to recognize human voice . After 40k generations , in software , over the course of a couple weeks , the hardware device was able to identify a human voice perfectly , and the scientists had absolutely no clue how it worked . Parts of the circuit were wired in weird ways and did n't connect to anything . When they removed that part of the circuit , the device stopped working . They could only reason that the algorithm implicitly took advantage of some electrical resonance or bleeding across circuits of that exact , particular , specific processor ( there are always manufacture flaws and variations between chips in a batch ) . There are software and now some fantastic hardware that represents neurons of the brain . These virtual neurons can be wired into a network , usually virtually . They 're allowed to rewire themselves with static algorithms that determine when a change is necessary , and each neuron can "" learn "" ; they use little equations to determine if they 're supposed to signal their outputs depending on their inputs , and this builds neural path ways . These algorithms are used in cochlear ( hearing ) implants , they 're used in stock market trading , they 're used in robots and vision systems , they 're popular in "" learning AI "" . Robots and virtual creatures can learn to walk and navigate a maze . They can simulate learning and memory . You 're basically making a little brain . In fact , Google finished a research project a few months ago where they simulated a small brain . The neural net was configured to model the physical structures of real animal brains , since we have a good understanding these days of that . The brain was allowed to consume information from a selection of internet data and guess what ? It really likes cats . No , I 'm not kidding . --- There are plenty more examples and different technologies . The basic algorithm may be static but it may also give rise to astounding complexity . Evolution itself is principally simple and our DNA sequences , when decoded , fill DVDs . We are not driven by simple algorithms of nature , but the astounding complexity ( data , DNA ) that comes from it . Computers are already doing this on a much smaller scale , but there 's no reason a computer ca n't achieve similar complexity . --- Briefly , you have to argue what you consider consciousness and self awareness even is . Does a single sell organism have consciousness ? I say a Furby has consciousness . For example , it is self aware when it is upside down , and it does n't like that . At a very low , primitive level , like that of a single celled organism , it is conscious .","Software developers often claim that all computers are made up of pre-fed algorithms, but this is an overly simplistic view.

This technology can be used to develop robot technology, fuel efficient engines, aerodynamic cars and planes,  virtual creatures and many more, with complexity so high that humans can’t necessarily explain it. Additionally, we are driven by the complexity of data and DNA produced by evolution, and computers are rapidly achieving similar complexities.

Our dispatch center dispatches for the county deputies , the state troopers , the park rangers , the wildlife officers , the US forest service officers , and local fire and EMS .

The county deputies take all of the calls on county roads , and county property . These calls may include domestic violence calls at a citizens houses , burglary alarms , citizen complains against each other , welfare checks , and civil problems . They also patrol the area proactively trying to prevent crime . They have a job very similar to a city police officer . The park rangers take care of all of the problems in state park jurisdiction , and the wildlife officers generally ride around on ATVS and look for poachers , and take care of the wildlife people encounter on their property . The US forest officer takes the calls in the national forest in our jurisdiction and patrols the highway the passes through it . He may also receive help from our deputies if need be because we have a deputy whose zone passes through his national forest . We also have a local police department in the area , but their dispatch is in another location and we occasionally coordinate . We can hear each others radio traffic , but do n't dispatch each others officers . Now , there are about 6 troopers ( Highway patrol ) on air in the busiest time , and they are separated into 3 zones . Each trooper is assigned a zone , and if we receive a call in their zone we generally ask them to respond . If all the troopers in their zone are unavailable , we ask the officer in charge to advise . The deputies have 4 zones with 6 deputies on duty . 4 deputies have their own zone ( so one in each zone ) and there is a float who will respond to any call if an officer is busy , and another call comes in in their zone . There is also a SGT on duty who is the boss of the crew . If a call comes in their zone , they are dispatched to it , and if deputies from another zone come to assist , the officer who is assigned to that zone will be in charge of the call ( write the big report , and if needed , take the prisoner into the jail ) .

So you would see a grid of boxes with people 's names on them . You find the one that belongs to Joe and you put the letter in there . This is kind of how computer 's talk to each other . The street address is the IP address of the computer ( say 192.168.1.1 ) and the grid of mailboxes is the port .

The idea is that by making the rich richer , wealth will "" trickle down "" to the poor . Hence the phrase "" trickle down economics . "" This has been shown to not actually work in real life . The only reason the rich are rich is because the poor ( the vast majority of the population , and therefore the vast majority of customers ) have money to spend on things that the rich make and sell . Further , when you consider that the poor SPEND most of their income , and the rich either hoard or invest it , it makes sense to use higher taxes to lift the tax burden off the poor so the economy can keep running . It also makes sense to use taxes to encourage the rich to invest their money into companies that build things and employ people instead of investing it into things that turn money into more money for no real work ( buying real estate , stocks , bonds ) , or worse , hoarding it in trust funds and offshore bank accounts ( often to avoid paying taxes on it ) . Yes , the richest people often pay more in taxes than the poor make in a year . BUT , when you consider that the rich are only rich because of the infrastructure that our tax dollars built it 's only fair that they pay a larger share . If there was no public education system , you would n't have any skilled workers to make your money with . If there were no roads you would n't be able to ship your goods far enough to become as rich as you are . In the end , the rich will end up paying a smaller portion ( if not a smaller amount ) of their income in taxes because of tax loopholes ( ie , because the capital gains tax is a lower percentage than income tax , and much of their income is from investments ) and because they spend less of their income , meaning less of their income goes to sales taxes and excise taxes . This is why Monaco , despite having an 18 % tax rate , is considered a tax haven . The poor end up paying a vastly higher effective tax rate ( assuming they spend 60 % of their income , they would be paying 10.8 % in taxes ) than the rich ( who , assuming they spend 10 % of the income , would be paying 1.8 % in tax ) . I use the terms poor and rich very loosely , of course .","Although the logic of ""trickle down economics"" has been shown to not actually work in real life, it is based on the idea that the ""poor"" (who work for the ""rich"") don't pay their fair share (which is partially true) and that reducing taxes on the rich will encourage them to invest it in job-creating activities, thereby ""trickling down"" wealth to the poor. However, the real reason the rich are so wealthy is because the majority of people (i.e. the poor) have money to spend on things the rich make and sell--and, as the poor spend most of their income and the rich typically hoard or invest theirs, it only makes sense to use higher taxes to lift the tax burden off the poor and to encourage the rich to invest their money into companies that build and employ rather than into things that simply turn money into more money. Yet, despite the fact that the wealthiest often pay more in taxes than the poor make in a year, it is also fair to consider that they are only rich because of the infrastructure built with taxpayer dollars, thus they should pay a greater share of their income. As such, the rich pay a smaller portion of their income in taxes due to loopholes like the lower capital gains tax and because they spend less of their income. On the other hand, the poor have an effective tax rate of 10.8%, far greater than the rich's 1.8%.",3.8525445461273193

Therefore , even if you could get enough oxygen it would be less than one atmosphere , maybe even less than one fifth of one atmosphere , in pressure , so it would be very difficult to breathe .","If you're looking for a mechanical device rather than an implantable organ, we have an easy answer: a snorkeling mask (which, of course, won't actually do what you want!). The reason behind this is because the oxygen concentration (partial pressure) in the water is much lower than the partial pressure of oxygen in the air, making it difficult for humans to breathe safely (we need a lot more oxygen than fish do). Extracting any solute from an area of low concentration and delivering it in an area of high concentration is a difficult task, especially if you need the right pressure so that it can be breathed in. The nitrogen content in water is even less than oxygen, so even if you could get enough oxygen, the pressure would be a lot less than one atmosphere.",4.458307266235352

After every flight, planes are serviced while many cars are not serviced as often as they should be. Also, since commercial jets are expensive, they are made with better quality than an average car, increasing safety. Additionally, becoming a qualified pilot requires many tests and hours of work, and once in the cockpit, a co-pilot is there to take over in cases of emergency, or if the pilot is not fit to fly.

Second , if you weigh 60 kilograms , you generate about 60 milliliters of urine each hour . And for 80 kilograms , about 80 milliliters per hour , and so on . Third , we humans seem to prefer to drink our alcohol in 10 gram lumps . Ten grams of alcohol is about 12.5 milliliters ( but you can call it 10 mL and still be fairly accurate ) . So each glass of beer , wine , or spirits has about 10 grams of alcohol . Fourth , alcohol interferes with the mechanism that regulates the water levels in our body . So now , a little anatomy and physiology . In your brain is a small gland called the pituitary gland . It is divided into two sections : the front ; and the back . The back section is called the posterior pituitary . One of the hormones made by the posterior pituitary gland is called vasopressin , or anti - diuretic hormone ( ADH ) . Diuresis is a fancy word meaning urination . Now suppose that you are really dehydrated . So the volume of water in your body is low . But you still have just as many salts floating in this reduced volume of water . So these salts are now more concentrated in the reduced volume of water that you have when you are dehydrated . Your body has detectors that can sense both the saltiness of your water , and the volume of the water . If these detectors reckon that you are dehydrated , they send a signal to the posterior pituitary gland , which starts pumping out ADH . The job of ADH is to stop you urinating , so you hang on to your precious water . You reduce your normal rate of making urine . Alcohol does the opposite . It reduces how much ADH you make , so it increases how much urine you produce . Each shot of alcohol that you drink forces your kidneys to generate an extra 120 milliliters of urine on top of the normal 60–80 milliliters per hour .","The body quickly absorbs alcohol - a small molecule - into the bloodstream and thus to the brain.

However, the SSA has stopped publishing this information (in the name of ‘fraud prevention’ as criminals were the only ones using it) and now wait one or two years before publishing any of the deceased information. To prevent being targeted, you can request a PIN from the IRS, get credit monitoring for a small monthly fee, opt out of consumer data, not give information that is not necessary and call the Big 3 (TransUnion, Experian, and Equifax) to have ID theft activity removed from your credit report.

592,592,592,192,592,"My theory is this : we humans have found the need to become self - controlled and disciplined for the good of our society . We keep our basic instincts in check so that we can focus on working together to build things and to make our lives better and free of danger . Obviously most of us like sex ... but we also do n't have sex anywhere , anytime we want . Society expects us to deal with our basic instincts in privacy . Those who can not do this are frowned upon because it shows a lack of self - control , a personality flaw that is seen as harmful to the well - being of our society . However , heterosexuality is more widely accepted ( or tolerated ) because it 's essential to life - that 's basically how you make babies . If you 're alive right now , chances are that your biological parents did the nasty at least once before . Homosexuality on the other hand is n't as widespread as heterosexuality so many people have trouble relating to it . They do n't understand its appeal . Because of that and because it does n't follow "" the norm "" , some people see homosexuality as a personality flaw , as the result of someone not being able to take control of their urges . It also does n't help that some gay people are extremely vocal about their sexual preference and may be attracted to heterosexual people , something which is n't reciprocated and can be the source of discomfort . In my opinion , the reason why some idiots are outraged about what gay people do in their own home is because they think their supposed "" lack of self - control "" is going to have a negative effect somewhere else in society .","Humans have learnt to become disciplined and self-controlled for the good of society, restraining our most basic instincts so that we can focus on building better lives and living without danger.

Conversely, heterosexuality is widely accepted as it is essential to life, while homosexuality is not so well-understood and consequently seen as morally wrong or a sign of loss of control.

This is a partial list made of the reasons people give for staying with an abusive partner , from a blog of someone who was in an abusive relationship herself , and talked to others in the same situation . The entire list is too long to post in one comment , so I 've put the titles here , but omitted the examples / explanations for the ones that are easier to understand . [ Here 's the link to her original full writing with examples for each reason here . ] ( URL_0 ) 1 . * * "" I do n't want to die . "" * * Her husband has told her that if she leaves he will kill her , and she believes this . ( She may well be right . ) The instant he gets a whiff of where she 's staying -- and he probably will , at some point , from a well - meaning friend or through the legal system or by persistent stalking or random chance -- he 's going to come there and he 's going to do something very , very bad to her . Staying with him may be horrible , but at least she gets to live . She believes that if she leaves , no one and nothing can protect her from his vengeance . 2 . * * "" I 'll die without her . "" * * He lives in his girlfriend 's apartment . He 's unemployed , or minimally employed , and has no education or good experience on his resume . He has no friends besides her . He 's gotten to the point where he does n't know how he 'll get food without her help , much less navigate all the challenges of life . And if he leaves her , he 'll be leaving everything -- she'll destroy any of his stuff that he leaves behind , stalk him so he ca n't stay at the same job , and even kill his pets . If he leaves her , he 's certain that he 'll end up living on the streets . 3 . * * "" He 'll die without me . "" * * 4 . * * "" What about the kids ? "" * * Right now , she protects the kids from her husband . He may rage at her , but she shelters them from the worst of it and she makes sure they have the best home she can give them under the circumstances . If she leaves , she doubts she can get sole custody of the kids without visitation , much less get it immediately . And if the kids are alone with him , something very bad will happen . He 'll hurt them , or turn them against her , or take them away and she 'll never see them again . Maybe all three . Her kids are her life and she ca n't bear to let something like that happen . 5 . * * "" I tried once , and it made things worse . "" * * This is n't the first time . He did call the cops on his husband before , and he ran away that night . The cops did n't find enough evidence , and when he came back to get his stuff , his husband was ... tearfully apologetic , actually . Somehow he talked him into staying and not taking his stuff . The punishment came later -- once he 'd more or less committed to staying around -- and it was horrible . But he 's afraid that if he tried to leave again , he 'd go through the same cycle again . 6 . * * "" I reached out once , and was rebuffed . "" * * In a rare moment of courage , he -- with shaking hands , summoning all his strength -- told someone he thought he could trust what his wife was doing to him . They told him to think about her point of view for once , to not use big drastic words like "" abuse , "" and to take care of his own damn problems without airing his dirty laundry . He just knows that if he reaches out again , it 's going to be the same thing . He 's lucky she did n't find out about that time and doubts if it 's worth taking the risk again . 7 . * * "" If I call the cops , I 'll be in trouble . "" * * She 's a prostitute . On the side , she sells drugs . She owns guns she should n't have and lives in a place she should n't be . Hell , she should n't even be in this country . Her lifestyle is so far outside the law that any attention from the police is likely to get her thrown in jail -- so she ca n't very well tell the police that her girlfriend beats her . 8 . * * "" Run away ? Call the cops ? I ca n't even get away with sneezing ! "" * * 9 . * * "" If it were so bad , someone would have done something . "" * * Everyone knows what 's going on in his life . His friends have seen his girlfriend hitting him ; his parents have heard him say "" I ca n't do that , she wo n't let me "" about a million things ; the neighbors have heard the screams and crashes when she explodes . He knows everyone knows already , and knows that they have n't done anything even though they know . So , he figures , what difference would it make to tell them ? Clearly they 've already decided that this is n't bad enough to call in the authorities over . 10 . * * "" It 's a joke to him , so it should be a joke to me . "" * * 11 . * * "" I 'm just terrified to hurt her feelings . "" * * Abuse has made her telepathic . Years of desperately trying to keep her girlfriend happy so bad things wo n't happen have made her keenly aware of her girlfriend 's every fleeting emotion . Her girlfriend is a tiny bit moody and she rushes to coddle and comfort her ; her girlfriend is a tiny bit happy and she just about throws a party for her . She 's so used to reading her girlfriend 's feelings and translating them into her own that she ca n't stand to do something that would really hurt her girlfriend 's feelings . Just the thought of dealing with that much anger -- when even a tiny amount of anger is a big deal in their house -- is too terrifying to imagine . 12 . * * "" I 'm so embarrassed I let him do this to me . "" * * 13 . * * "" I 've learned to live in her system . "" * * He knows all the rules by now . As long as he always treats his wife with the utmost politeness and gentleness , and always has dinner ready before she comes home , always is up for sex when she wants it , and always lets her make the decisions , things are okay . He actually feels pretty safe when he 's being "" good . "" So it does n't seem like there 's anything wrong with the relationship , because it goes great so long as he does as he 's supposed to . 14 . * * "" We 're outsiders ; no one cares about our problems . "" * * They 're a lesbian couple , one of them is transgendered , and they 're kinky to boot . She 's had enough problems just explaining to the "" authorities "" that their relationship exists ; how the hell is she supposed to convey that there 's something wrong with it ? She 's internalized enough prejudice that she figures it 's sort of her own fault for being in such a strange relationship , and she does n't figure anyone cares that much about the troubles of a weirdo . 15 . * * "" After all he 's done for a jerk like me ? "" * * Her husband has put up with so much from her . This is n't # 13 ; these were genuinely bad things . He helped her pay off the nasty credit card debt she was in . He stayed with her even after she got fired from her job and flunked out of school ; he even bailed her out of jail when she really fucked up . Who could blame the guy if he loses his patience now and then ? She figures she really is a very difficult person to live with , she deserves some punishment for all she 's screwed up , and she should be grateful that he 's kept her around at all . As he reminds her when she 's pushed him too far -- who else would love her ? 16 . * * "" She 's really nice ... mostly . "" * * Her wife is super sweet and loving . She 's a flowers - and - chocolates romantic , a believer in true love and love at first sight , and she treats her just like a princess . Except now and then , things get tense in the relationship , and bad things happen . Really bad things . Her wife just does n't seem like herself and she explodes . But the apology is even sweeter and lovinger than before and things are good again . Maybe it was a one - off . Or a two - off . A three - off ? Maybe this really is the last time and from now on she 'll just have the nice wife she fell in love with . She 's certainly being nice now , and how could you leave someone like that ? 17 . * * "" It just is n't done in our community . "" * * 18 . * * "" Actually , I 'm abusing her . "" * * When she explodes , she does n't tell her boyfriend "" I hate you ; "" she tells him "" you hate me . "" She tells him that he 's hurting her , that she 's responding the way she is because she just ca n't take his abuse any more , and he believes her . He 's trying desperately to treat her right , to treat her the way she deserves , and he just keeps fucking up . Often when she 's yelling he yells back -- sometimes he even hits back -- and that makes him more sure than ever that he 's the real abuser here . 19 . * * "" It 's not that bad . "" * * She firmly believes that real abuse is when they punch you -- and her husband 's only slapped her with an open hand . Real abuse is when they beat you -- and he only yells at her until she cries and then yells at her to stop crying . Real abuse is when they rape you -- and he always makes her say "" yes "" before he has sex with her , no matter how little she wants it . She recognizes there 's something wrong in their relationship , but could never call it like , abuse abuse , and so she ca n't react to it like it 's real abuse . 20 . * * "" This is how relationships work , is n't it ? "" * * Her parents ' relationship was a constant cycle of drama and violence . Her relationship with her parents was just as bad . Her high school boyfriend hit her and her college boyfriend made her have sex when she did n't want it . She kinda figures everyone else 's relationship is just the same behind the scenes . All she worries about is how to make the best of an abusive relationship ; while she knows it intellectually , she does n't believe deep down that a non - abusive relationship is possible , at least for her .","Staying with an abusive partner is an ongoing problem and can be due to a variety of reasons, including fear of death, the belief that they would die without the abuser, fear of repercussions towards the children, not wanting to hurt their feelings, familiarly accepting the abuser's system, feeling that no one cares about their problems, being too embarrassed to leave, believing it is not as bad as it seems, not wanting to hurt the abuser's feelings, believing this is how relationships work, and feeling that there is no way to get away with anything. In many of these cases, the person may feel that they are stuck, and that the best thing to do is to stay with the abuser.

Through a process called osmosis a portion of the water would fairly rapidly be drawn into nearby cells , in particular the red blood cells . Many of these cells would expand in volume rapidly to the point that their cell membranes would rupture , spilling their contents into the circulation . For a very small amount of water there would be no lasting harm . As the amount increases more red cells would be damaged . The harm from this falls into two categories - as you lose red blood cells , your blood is less able to carry oxygen to other parts of the body , and the substances leaking from the injured cells would in large enough quantities cause harm themselves since the balance of what is kept inside and outside of these cells is delicate and well regulated . If , instead of plain water , water with solutes in roughly the same concentration as the plasma was introduced ( such as "" normal saline "" ) , and the quantities were not ridiculous , then it would simply become part of your circulating blood volume . Over time the extra fluid would end up dividing between your circulating blood volume , the insides of various cells , and the fluid that surrounds cells in your body outside of the circulation .

The most plausible one , espoused by a number of scientists who are n't this guy , is that the shiver is a result of two parts of the autonomic nervous system ( ANS ) getting their streams crossed . The ANS is a control system for involuntary muscles affects things like heart and respiration rates , digestion , body temperature control and urination . The ANS has two divisions . The sympathetic nervous system ( SNS ) controls bladder function , among other things . It keeps the bladder relaxed and the urethral sphincter contracted so you do n't have to concentrate on not peeing your pants all day . The parasympathetic nervous system ( PNS ) relaxes the urethral sphincter and contracts the bladder when you decide to answer nature 's call . Part of the SNS response to a full bladder is the release of chemicals like catecholamines ( which include epinephrine , norepinephrine and dopamine ) . When you finally grab a minute to urinate , the PNS takes over , and catecholamine production changes . Some sources point at the change in chemical production as the cause of the shiver , and others say it 's the SNS to PNS switch itself that does it .","The most plausible answer to why people shiver when they need to pee is because two parts of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) are getting their signals crossed: the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), which keeps the bladder relaxed and the urethral sphincter contracted, and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), which relaxes the urethral sphincter and contracts the bladder when someone decides to answer nature's call.

617,617,617,217,617,"It 's not known , but there is some speculation . Essentially , the various grammatical markers that indicate grammatical gender may be ultimately derived from the language 's words for "" man "" and "" woman "" , or "" he "" and "" she "" , for example , originally only used for people , then all animals . This then became a way to categorize other nouns as well . Somtimes , the connection is not too hard to understand . For example , in ancient societies there were gods and goddesses associated with all sorts of things . The sun might be seen as having male qualities -- it 's strong at any rate -- and so to the Romans , Sol , the sun - deity , was clearly a male god , which is why , for example , the French word for "" the sun "" , "" le soleil "" , is masculine ; the moon , on the other hand , being much more gentle , was ruled by a goddess , Luna , hence the French word for "" the moon "" , "" la lune "" , which is feminine . Another way of assigning grammatical gender is by the form of the word itself . Once you have established a list of masculine words and a list of feminine words , you might notice that masculine words follow a certain pattern , while feminine words follow a different pattern . So you allocate new words a gender depending on whether they follow a typical "" masculine "" pattern or a typical "" feminine "" pattern . In Russian , for example , words ending in a consonant are usually masculine , words ending in "" -a "" or "" -ya "" are usually feminine , and words ending in "" -o "" are usually neuter . This explains the famous example of the German word for "" girl "" being neuter . The German word referred to is "" Mädchen "" . This comes from the ( now old - fashioned ) word "" Magd "" , which is feminine and means "" maid "" . The "" -chen "" ending is what 's called a diminutive , and translates as "" little "" -- so "" Mädchen "" means "" little maid "" , and is where we get our word "" maiden "" . But in German , all words with diminutive endings are automatically neuter , no matter what they refer to . By this stage , of course , grammatical gender is a completely different concept from actual gender or sex , and is really just a classification system and no longer an indication of whether something is male or female . English has now come full circle , and we use "" natural gender "" , meaning that women and female animals are feminine , men and male animals are masculine , and inanimate objects are neuter . There are some exceptions ; for example , ships are often referred to as "" she "" , probably because the crew depends on her to keep them alive and safe , but she can be difficult to control ( these are stereotypical female qualities , of course ) .","It is not known for certain, but there is some speculation that the various grammatical markers used to indicate grammatical gender may have originated from words used to refer to ""man"" or ""woman"", or ""he"" or ""she"". This was initially used only to refer to people, and then to categorize animals, and there are some connections that are evident; for example, in many ancient societies, there were gods and goddesses associated with different things and qualities, such as the sun being seen as having male qualities and thus being ruled by a Roman solar deity in the form of Sol, and the moon as having more gentle qualities and thus being ruled by a goddess, Luna. Another way of assigning grammatical gender is according to the form of the word itself, meaning that if a word follows a typical ""masculine"" pattern, it will be allocated a masculine gender, and if it follows a feminine pattern, a feminine gender, such as in Russian where words ending in a consonant are masculine, words ending in "" -a "" or "" -ya "" are feminine, and words ending in "" -o "" are neuter; this explains the example of the German word for "" girl "" being neuter, which comes from the (now old-fashioned) word "" Magd "", which is feminine and means ""maid"", but the "" -chen "" ending makes it automatically neuter. Thus, grammatical gender is no longer an indication of actual gender or sex, but rather a classification system, and English has now come full circle and uses "" natural gender "", where female animals, women, and inanimate objects are feminine and male animals, men, are masculine.",4.499625205993652

One of my favorite comments was something like , "" In a boxing match , boxers do not get to choose which blows they consent to receiving -- rather , they consent to the entirety of engagement .

Hockey , for example , penalizes intentional , violent violations of its rules with varying penalty - box repercussions , suspensions , etc .

In UK law you must have a license to sell alcohol , a license to have it consumed on your ( public commercial ) premises and another personal license to facilitate this sale .

Physical factors like genetic disposition are another common possible explanation . In the following , the most important theories are presented in chronological order : Alfred Binet suspected fetishism was the pathological result of associations . Accidentally simultaneous presentation of a sexual stimulus and an inanimate object , he argued , led to the object being permanently connected to sexual arousal . The sexologist Magnus Hirschfeld followed another line of thought when he proposed his theory of partial attractiveness in 1920 . According to his argument , sexual attractiveness never originates in a person as a whole but always is the product of the interaction of individual features . He stated that nearly everyone had special interests and thus suffered from a healthy kind of fetishism , while only detaching and overvaluing of a single feature resulted in pathological fetishism .

The larger party in the current coalition government . A centre - right party , and so are interested in lowering taxes and using free trade as a means to bolster the economy . They believe in small government , which under Thatcher meant privatisation of public services like railways , utilities and the mail . These services used to be run by the government , but were sold off to private companies . Under the current administration , they have been cutting the budgets of remaining public services like welfare , local authorities and the NHS at the same time as cutting taxes for top - earners and letting companies like Starbucks and Vodafone away with not paying corporation tax . Basically letting the rich get richer and the poor get shat on . * * Labour * * - traditionally the party of the working class , and up until the late 1990s , the opposite of the Tories . They are a centre - left party , interested in a society in which the rich help the poor by way of free public services , a robust welfare system , and higher taxation for the wealthy . Before the 1997 general election , Tony Blair took the party in a new direction ( "" New Labour "" ) which similarly appealed to the middle classes as well as the working class . Effectively , he moved the party away from all - out socialism to a more centrist party . The party is now at odds with itself , with some members looking for "" Blairism , "" a more centrist party , and others still rocking the old socialism . The party does not have a strong leader , they are about to lose swathes of voters in Scotland which was previously a Labour stronghold ( more on this later ) , and do not have policies which could reverse the damage done to the lower classes ' quality of life under the current administration .

They do n't have the electoral clout to stop the Tories ' harsher policies , and have gone back on their own election promises ( like not raising tuition fees ) . Their leader was once seen as a ray of sunshine in British politics , now he is just Cameron 's stooge . * * UKIP * * - the UK Independence party . The party started as a crowd of ex - Tories who were annoyed by the Conservative party 's embracing of European politics . They pledged to withdraw the UK from the European Union . They do alarmingly well in council and European elections , and seem to draw media attention far greater than their electoral representation should warrant . They have policies on immigration that seem outright racist , and have a habit of blaming immigration for all the country 's woes . People will still vote for them , because people turn to nationalism in times of austerity , sad as that is . * * SNP * * - the Scottish National Party . Speaking of nationalism ... There was a referendum on Scottish independence this year . The pro - independence side lost , but not by very much . The final vote was 55%-45 % in favour of staying in the union .

They are now apparently the third - largest party in the UK , despite only representing 10 % of its population . Scottish Labour were pro - union during the referendum , which many party supporters saw as a betrayal , since they were jumping into bed with the Tories ( properly called the Conservative & Unionist Party ) . Labour support in Scotland has plummeted . Away from the referendum , the SNP do extraordinarily well as leaders of the devolved Scottish Government . They are the majority party in an electoral system that is not supposed to allow one party to hold an outright majority . They have very popular policies like free travel for over-60s , free prescriptions for all , low tuition fees and a student loan system , and a freeze on council tax .

To these women too , these kind of ravishment fantasies can also be highly attractive , because it basically means that a guy finds them so attractive ( even if they do n't find themselves attractive ) that he can not contain himself . Fifty Shades of Grey plays into a lot of these sexual tropes , which is what made it so popular . It is also written in a very simple , accessible way , so it is easy to pick up even by people who do n't read a lot . ( Just as a note , there are also a lot of men that have ravishment fantasies . Not quite as many as women , but it is not a female - only thing or something . )","Well, in terms of actual BDSM, Fifty Shades of Grey is an incredibly poor book, as the protagonist is a textbook example of a shitty and abusive dom. However, it isn't targeted towards people in the BDSM lifestyle, but instead towards average women with a ravishment fantasy, as demonstrated by a college study which found almost half of women had these fantasies. This is because they are a way of avoiding guilt, as women are inundated with conflicting messages around sex and are often made to feel guilty for enjoying it. Ravishment fantasies provide a way of bypassing this guilt, as it's someone else 'forcing' them to do something, while those with low self-esteem may find it attractive that someone is so drawn to them. Fifty Shades of Grey was hugely popular due to its simple yet accessible writing style, and its play into sexual tropes. It should also be noted that while less common, ravishment fantasies aren't solely a female thing.",3.998377799987793

705,705,705,5,705,"US politics are extremely divided along internal cultural lines . It is exceedingly rare in the US to change which party you vote for - they appeal to an entirely different group of people , and focus their policies around that group of people . Where many other democracies have parties who 's fortunes rise and fall with the economy or popular culture , in America you are either liberal or conservative , and you generally will shift at most once in your lifetime . Red States are states that almost always vote Republican . Places like Utah or Texas , where a majority of people are conservatives . Blue States are states that almost always vote Democrat .

This is a place where the ebb and flow of politics has an impact , because how ' energized ' conservatives or liberals feel will impact how many go to the polls . Because of that , these states change who they vote for from election to election - not because their citizens change parties , but because when 10 % fewer liberals vote than usual that electorate swings conservative .

It 's one of the main reasons America sorely needs electoral reform .","US politics are highly divided based on cultural lines and it is very uncommon for American citizens to alter their party affiliation; Republicans and Democrats appeal to two different constituencies and focus their policies on them.

Red States, like Utah and Texas, are populated mainly by conservatives, while in Blue States like New York and California, the majority of citizens are liberals. Swing states, on the other hand, are equal in their support for both parties and are affected by the motivation of the liberals and conservatives to turn out to vote. As a result, this has caused the two parties to construct their policies to invigorate their bases, instead of attempting to reach all of America, thus making it an even more contentious issue requiring an electoral reform.",4.806418418884277

732,732,732,32,732,"There are many different reasons to enjoy alcohol . In moderate doses , it makes you feel more relaxed , it may have some health benefits , it enhances the taste of food ( the right wine pairing is an excellent complement to a good meal ) , it can taste good on itself , etc . Beer is extremely refreshing in a hot day , and can be warming in a cold day , depending on the type of beer . To young people , it is attractive because it can make you feel happier , more confident , and take more risks . This is particularly attractive if you are just learning how to behave socially , need to make friends in a strange place , would like to start dating , need to relieve stress - all common situations in college , especially for freshmen . But I think that there is a distortion , in particular in the US . Alcohol in college becomes more important than it should be because for most of the kids , it has been such a taboo most of their lives . College is the first time that you may find yourself without close supervision and surrounded by people your age who have access to alcohol . Then you turn 21 and suddenly you can legally have the stuff . As a result , most Americans are completely unprepared for this , when the time comes . They do n't know what they like , they do n't know what their limits are , they do n't know how their bodies will react , and they have to deal with peer pressure telling them that drinking is required and that being wasted is desirable fro some reason . Finally , there is a small percentage of the population who are vulnerable to alcohol addiction , which is something that you really do n't want in your life . It 's like most other addictions , except that it is very visible , very public , and very hard to escape . For all these reasons , my suggestion is simply , be careful . Do n't let yourself get carried away . Put a very small limit on yourself . Go to a party , for instance , with the firm limit of 1 beer . No matter how you feel then , do n't push that limit . After you go home and it wears off , think about it and see if it would be wise to raise your limit next time . No matter who you are , though , more then 4 or 5 beers in one event are a bad sign . Stay away from hard liquors as much as you can . If / when you are ready to try , make sure you do it with a group of friends , and that at least one of you is going to be sober . You will eventually get a hangover , inevitably . Remember that if you feel bad , it 's for a reason - you probably pushed your body more than it was able to go . Finally , remember that in large quantities alcohol can kill . Every year there are reports of kids killing themselves in colleges , by drinking too much and not knowing how to deal with it . As a parent , this is one of my biggest fears . So know that it is not normal for someone to drink so much that they pass out . If this happens to someone around you , be a true friend and try to stop them . If you ca n't and they do pass out , try to wake them up . Take them home , give them a shower , have them drink some coffee . They can sleep after they feel better . Most important , if someone has been drinking a lot , passes out , and you ca n't wake them up , please , please call 911 or take them to a hospital . Yes , there will be consequences , but any consequence is better than your friend dying because no one was responsible enough , brave enough to get them help when they need it . be safe .","Alcohol is attractive to young people, especially in college, for many reasons, from its ability to make you feel more relaxed, happier, and more confident, to its potential health benefits and its ability to enhance a meal.

762,762,762,62,762,"Hey there , aerospace engineer here who has experience in the space industry , and with college level mission design and analysis specifically oriented towards manned Mars missions . Mars one does not have the funding , technology , resources , time , scientific understanding , or technical acumen needed to pull off a mission of the caliber they are proposing . For their mission to succeed , several major things will need to change ; most are completely outside of the organization 's control . First , they will need an exorbitant amount of funds . Their projected plan is to use around $ 6 billion . Not only is this a ludicrously small amount , it 's a pretty sure sign of just how serious their program is ( not at all ) . As a conservative estimate , $ 20 billion is probably a better first guess for development of a Mars surface habitat capable of sustaining 4 people for a number of years . Cost drivers include a complete lack of appropriate Mars EDL ( entry , decent , and landing ) capabilities for large cargo , lack of a properly secured life support and resource utilization loop , launch and in space propulsion costs ( which alone would cost more than their projected mission costs to put several dozen tons of cargo on Mars ) , and other similarly large obstacles that require a good deal of funding well before their company will be able to sell the media rights to anyone ( and as far as I , or anyone else in the public is aware , no one is interested in buying to the tune of $ 6 + billion ) . Technology , science , and R & D : as I 've already pointed out , there are huge technical gaps left to completing a Mars mission , even ignoring the whole "" bring your astronauts home "" problem . Launch costs , Mars EDL , and life support are only the most visible and ( probably ) most costly examples . There are a huge variety of additional technical hurdles that Mars one has made little to no effort to adequately address . No human has ever spend more than a few days in an environment between 1 and 0 g 's . No one has created ISRU capabilities that are ready for industrial use and consumption on Mars . No one has used machines to remotely construct a habitat in a space - like environment , beyond self constructing satellites . No one has built structures on Mars ; the long term corrosive and erosive effects are not understood or adequately modelable on Earth . No one has sampled Martian soil , or measured it 's effects as a possible radiation shield ; without knowing how effective it is , it 's impossible to determine how much needs to be used to safely accommodate your astronauts , and thus how strong your structure needs to be to support it . No one has studied the psychological effects operating on astronauts embarking on known one way missions ; it is difficult to predict how team dynamics will play out , and how the astronaut 's sanity and productivity will be impacted . I could go on , but I think the point is clear . As far as time goes , their proposed schedule is as questionable as their budget , if not more so . With an initial funding of less than a few million dollars , they plan to have a custom built rover designed , built , launched , and to land on Mars by the early 2020 's . Let that sink in for a moment . This sort of endeavor takes many millions of dollars , and years just to develop . Their reason for optimism ? That they are going to reuse designs . To anyone who 's worked in the space program , this is a dubious way to save time and money . While it 's certainly better than starting from scratch ( in some cases ) , entire aspects of the rover 's design will always need to be re - examined , re built , re optimized , re analyzed , and re assessed for their impacts on the surrounding structure . I ca n't go to Lockheed Martin and buy another Mars rover , for buy one get one free . These things are n't bicycles , they are some of the most complicated pieces of robotic equipment designed and built . Testing alone takes years , unless you have the money to burn and risk to take to accelerate the schedule . And again , almost all of their proposed structures are going to need to be designed , redesigned , built , tested , redesigned , rebuilt , and retested from scratch , over many years and for billions of dollars . Their assessment of and relationship to the aerospace industry is also questionable . A true development plan does not consist of "" We will pay companies to design and build components to meet our needs "" . You ca n't go to one company , pay for a Mars rover to build your habitat , then go to another and pay for a habitat , then get to Mars and expect them to work together . You need teamwork , integration , cross compatible requirements and design considerations , communication between organizations concerned about intellectual property , profits , and competition , systems level testing and program management , clear program driving factors , and everything else that goes into making a mission like Apollo or ISS or Skylab work . To give one more , truly solid idea of just how unrealistic their plans are , consider this . To get to the moon on Apollo 8 , three astronauts launched atop a Saturn V in an Apollo CSM . The command / service module had a mass of almost 30 metric tons . It could support three astronauts for two weeks , with around 2 cubic meters of space for each astronaut . At the end of that journey , it was discarded . It had no ability to recycle food or water or air , or generate power . And it was launched on that journey by the Saturn V , the largest rocket ever to launch humans into space , a rocket that had more than twice the payload capacity of the Falcon Heavy , Mars one 's proposed launch vehicle . It took the full force of the US government , spending billions of dollars a year for almost a decade , to build the capabilities to travel to the moon , and the tools , engineering base , and equipment involved . Have spacecraft come significantly further in the intervening decades ? Yes . Has our understanding of the problems involved with a Mars mission ? Yes . Are we considerably more ready to tackle the challenge ? Yes . But that does n't change the fundamental variables : you need mass . You need time . You need money . You need expertise . You need launchers . You need organization , skill , planning , coordination , and a bureaucratic machine built to handle the legal , regulatory , ethical , and political ramifications of the mission you are undertaking . These are the things Mars one lacks ; not ideas or enthusiasm or spirit , but manpower and money and influence .","Hey there, as an aerospace engineer with experience in the space industry, specifically in mission design and analysis for manned Mars missions, it is clear that Mars One does not have the necessary funding, technology, resources, time, scientific understanding, and technical acumen to pull off the mission they are proposing.

The extremely tight timeline they are proposing due to the lack of funding and technical expertise is another major roadblock, as it would take many years just to develop the capabilities necessary to travel to a Red Planet.

784,784,784,84,784,"Lifelong Londoner here . I 'll try to explain . First , you have one outright mistake in your question , and a couple of points of confusion . The outright mistake is this : "" Camden is a borough in the city of Westminster "" . No , it is n't . So let 's try to clarify . "" Greater London "" is a geographic and political entity . It 's approximately 600 square miles in size and has a population of around 8.5 million people . Certain functions , such as transport and many development and economic issues , are considered important enough that there is an elected mayor for the whole of Greater London ( known , unsurprisingly , as the Mayor of London , but we 'll come back to this ) , and an elected body , the Greater London Assembly , which between them set policies . The Mayor and GLA also provide the budget for the police and fire service in London , and have a say in their running . To provide more local representation and deal with less London - wide issues , Greater London is then subdivided into 33 boroughs . One of these boroughs is the London Borough of Camden , another is the London Borough of the City of Westminster ( we 'll come to the reason for it having "" city "" in its name later ) . But Camden and Westminster are completely separate entities ; apart from the fact that they 're both one of the 33 boroughs they have nothing else in common . Most of the boroughs have an official name of "" The London Borough of * whatever * "" but a couple are called "" The City of * whatever * "" . This is because the history of human settlement in the London area dates way , way , back , long before the establishment of Greater London . For example the city of Westminster grew up from about the 10th century , so as the area that was later called London grew it was eventually swallowed up . The borough retains the name of what was once a separate , independent city , however . And then there 's the borough called "" The City of London "" . This one is special in many ways . The City of London ( the word "" City "" is * * always * * spelt with a capital in this context ) is tiny . It 's only about one square mile in size . It 's essentially the area that once sat within the old Roman walls of their city of * Londinium * , and today it 's completely dominated by being the headquarters of many financial companies -- so much so that in the UK simply saying "" The City "" is a shorthand way of saying "" financial services companies "" , just as in the US saying "" Wall Street "" has the same connotation . Despite being a borough of Greater London , the City of London has many special privileges and rights , which have been laid down over about a thousand years worth of legislation . In particular it elects its own mayor , known as "" The Lord Mayor of London "" although this is now a ceremonial position rather than one with any specific power . The City has its own separate police force from the rest of Greater London , has many of its own laws , and ( somewhat controversially ) positions on the City of London council are voted for by the corporations that are based in the City , rather than the ( very few ) people who live there , as happens in every other UK election .","A lifelong Londoner here to clarify: Greater London is an approximately 600-square-mile geographic and political entity with a population of 8.5 million people, and is divided into 33 boroughs, of which two are the London Borough of Camden and the London Borough of the City of Westminster. However, the City of Westminster did not originate as part of greater London; it actually grew up from the 10th century and was later subsumed by the larger city. The City of London is different as it is only one square mile and functions as the headquarters of many financial companies, electing its own mayor, aka ""The Lord Mayor of London"" (today a largely ceremonial position).

787,787,787,87,787,"Just like everyone else ; the English alphabet does n't change if you 're Chinese ... On a more serious note , there are two ways : 1 . You group in radicals ( i.e. the radical 女 means "" woman "" and makes all characters that contain it have a feminine quality : - 妈 = Mother - 姐 = older sister - 好 = good Within radicals , you group by number of strokes needed to write that radical : - 女 takes 3 strokes to write - 木 takes 4 strokes to write Therefore , words that contain 女 as a radical come before those that contain 木 in a dictionary . For a complete list of radicals in the order they come in a dictionary : URL_3 2 . The other way to alphabetize is quite modern since it 's a western adaptation . Every character in mandarin Chinese can be pronounced using the western alphabet plus an accent , so in dictionaries that use this classification , they 'll convert 女 to "" nǚ "" , 妈 to "" mā "" , 姐 to "" jiě "" . It would work just like an English dictionary , j coming before m , 姐 would come before 妈 . Now to classify accents , they follow this simple order : - Flat accent ( horizontal line above the letter you want accented ) comes first : - ( e.g. ā ) - Ascending accent comes second : / ( e.g. é ) - Valley accent comes third : v ( e.g. ě ) - Descending accent comes fourth and last : \ ( e.g. à ) There are of course special cases like ¨ , but that 's more advanced , and not incredibly relevant to the main question .

The second, more modern method is to convert characters into their Western alphabet equivalents plus an accent, for example 女 = nǚ, 妈 = mā, 姐 = jiě, and classify the accents in this order: flat accent (horizontal line above the letter) first (e.g. ā), ascending accent (e.g. é), valley accent (e.g. ě), and descending accent (e.g. à). The third and final method is to sort characters by the number of strokes needed to write the radical (e.g. 女 take 3 strokes, 木 take 4 strokes) which is followed in many dictionaries.",3.9375903606414795

If you tried to print it 10 "" x 10 "" , you would have 100 dots per inch ( 1,000 dots / 10 inches = 100 dots per inch ) . On the other hand , if you tried printing a 5 "" x 5 "" print , you would have 200 dots per inch and the picture would look much clearer . Ideally , you want at least 300 dots per inch for quality prints . Since real images are rarely square , you have to choose one dimension to work with , usually the width . A 12 - megapixel image is usually 4368 ( wide ) by 2912 ( height ) pixels . So , if you want to print a 4x6 , you end up with 4368 / 6 = 728 DPI ( measured by width ) That is about double the quality that you actually need to print . To answer your question , you can work the other way , too , with some algrbra . If 300 DPI is acceptable to you : 4368 / x = 300 DPI 300x = 4368 x = 14.5 "" And since y = 2/3 x , y = 9.7 "" So , maintaining a minimum of 300 DPI , the biggest picture you could print is 14.5 "" x 9.7 "" You could print it larger with lower quality , and the smaller you print it , the better it would look . On the other hand , if your printer prints at 300 or 360 DPI maximum , having a picture with more detail will not help . That turned into a long answer ! Hope it helps ...","DPI, or dots-per-inch, is a measurement useful for determining the quality of a print. For example, a 1,000x1,000 pixel picture, which would be 1 megapixel, could be printed 10""x10"", giving you 100 DPI, or 5""x5"", giving you 200 DPI - the latter giving a clearer picture. Ideally, 300 DPI is the desired quality for good prints, and you can work out the size to print by re-arranging the formula. For example, if you have a 12 megapixel picture with dimensions 4368 (width) by 2912 (height) and you want to print a 4x6 with 300 DPI, you'd have 4368/x=300 DPI, giving you x=14.5"", and y=9.7"". You can print larger with lower quality, but the smaller it is, the better it will look - however, if your printer prints at 300 or 360 DPI maximum, having a picture with more detail won't help.",4.179397106170654

First , when a lobbyist gives money , they 're probably not giving their own money . Instead , they they are giving money from a Political Action Committee which collects money from other donors . Corporations can also have corporate PACs . This is important because lobbyists are speaking on behalf of others . In the US there is a constitutional right to petition government . Donating to political campaigns is also recognized an as expression of free speech . The US also has a strong tradition of legal representation -- Americans generally want a lawyer to advise them on issues in the courtroom whereas in some other , often authoritarian countries , you do n't have that luxury and are forced to navigate a complex legal system you do nt understand by yourself . So when a lobbyist donates money to a politicians campaign , they are ( 1 ) assisting donors to exercise their freedom of speech and ( 2 ) assisting donors to petition their government . Lobbyists are specialists , just like plumbers or lawyers . They understand the byzantine way that a government works and they can provide expert advice about what is realistic , what is ethical and how to accomplish a goal . So , now the question is , does money equal access . The answer , based on a long history of studies is -- yes . Money does get you access . But you can also get access when you do n't give money . And you can be ignored even if you do give money . Getting in the door is really hard and really important . I ca n't tell you how many hours I 've spent just trying to figure out how to get into a room . That said , getting into a room does n't get you anything more than face time . I 've sat across a coffee table from members of congress who loathed the group I represented . Being in their presence did n't get me anything ( other than making conservative members of my group happy that i reached out ) . I do not agree that corruption is getting in the room . It does n't actually get you anything . Getting something is ... well ... getting something . And yes , you do see that some companies are able to getting everything that they want from certain members of congress , but the reality is that * * they were bought and sold before they even ran for office . * * Another thing -- if you talk to lobbyists , a large percentage , i 'd say half , will say that money really does ruin politics . I personally believe in 100 % public financed campaigns and a prohibition on any contribution or in kind contribution . It will never happen , and the reason is not because politicians wo n't let it happen . The reason is that the public wo n't let it happen . Politicians are n't any different than anyone else .

Lobbyists also help donors exercise their freedom of speech through political campaigns. Fundamentally, lobbyists are like any other specialist, offering expert advice on the byzantine world of politics. On the question of money and access, studies have shown a correlation, but access is possible without money, just as money alone does not guarantee access. It is not corruption that gets you into the room, it's getting something out of it that matters.

820,820,820,120,820,"Yes , broadly speaking . Atoms gain their properties due to their valence . Learning about this is basically most of the first semester of a college chemistry course , but the short version is : Atoms are basically clouds of electrons surrounding a core of protons and neutrons . The clouds of electrons behave in a way that is random , but overall very predictable , and they try to form a pattern that resembles a shell of electrons composed of sets of four pairs to make an octet . Bigger atoms have many shells of eight , smaller ones may have only one ( or fewer than one complete shell ) but it 's only the outermost shell that really matters for bonding and chemical properties . When two elements bond , they share an electron or two to fulfil their octets . Different atoms as you go down a row of the periodic table have different numbers of valience electrons in their outermost shell . These are what make atoms react differently . Lithium , sodium , potassium , etc , have one atom in their outermost valience shell - that means they want to bond very much with something that can fill their shell . If you put sodium in water , it rips the water apart , and causes an explosion as the oxygen and hydrogen heat up . Likewise , flourine , chlorine , iodine , etc , all have seven electrons in their outer shell - they want badly to fill with things with only one electron , like hydrogen . That 's why these elements can make such powerful acids - it 's very easy for them to steal a hydrogen from water . Carbon has four electons . It ( and silicon , to a lesser degree ) is the whore of the elemnts . It loves to bond with a lot of stuff becuase there 's so many ways it can make pairs . Oxygen has six , so it loves to double bond ( share two pairs of electrons ) with carbon , or one each with hydrogen ( to make water . ) Finally the nobel gasses come complete with eight already . That 's why they hardly ever bond with * anything * .

Atoms are composed of a core of protons and neutrons surrounded by a cloud of electrons which behave in a predictable, yet random way, with sets of four pairs forming an octet.

Carbon and Oxygen have four and six electrons respectively, and are therefore incredibly versatile with Carbon able to bond with many elements while Oxygen likes to double bond with Carbon or bond with Hydrogen (making water). Finally, the noble gasses have 8 electrons and so rarely bond with anything. This is only a brief explanation, as there is much more to explore, such as radioactivity, transition elements, different levels of valence shells, different types of bonds, andsubatomic forces.

Second , the fissile material in the atomic bombs was vaporized . I do n't mean that it disappeared , completely , but I mean was turned into plasma in the explosion .

864,864,864,164,864,"See , you do n't actually fall asleep all at once . It 's more of a well - defined process that everyone makes their way through in their own time . I 'll attempt to explain it . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- You start off moving into what 's called Stage 1 , from being completely awake . When you first lay down to go to sleep , you pass from your awake state to what 's called Alpha state . You 've daydreamed before , right ? That 's basically Alpha state . You 're still mostly conscious , but you start to see some little bouts of color behind your eyes ( hypnogogic hallucinations ) and you start to feel more relaxed . After Alpha , you enter Theta state . Theta state is when you could technically be considered asleep . This is when you move completely into sleep paralysis ( have you felt like you were falling then woken up with a start ? that 's sleep paralysis setting in and you not being completely unaware when it happened ) . You 're still sleeping relatively lightly , but if you can get through this stage you move into deeper sleep . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- The next major stage of sleep is called Stage 2 . Your brain starts to produce short periods of rapid brain waves that are called Sleep Spindles . This is the precursor to what comes next in sleep , deep sleep . Your body temperature begins to drop and your heart rate slows down , settling you in for the night . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 3 . When you enter stage 3 , really slow brain waves called Delta waves start happening . This is the true transition between light and deep sleep . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ You then enter Stage 4 . Stage four is commonly referred to as Delta Sleep because of the brain waves associated with it . It 's a deep sleep that lasts for about thirty minutes . You are the technically the most asleep in this stage . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Here 's where it gets interesting . There is another stage of sleep unlike all the others . It 's called Stage 5 , or REM sleep . REM stands for Rapid Eye Movement , your eyes literally start moving rapidly behind your eyelids . Your breathing rate increases , and your brain waves shoot up to almost as active as if you were awake . Your voluntary muscles become completely paralyzed , and you start dreaming . REM is also where most of the body 's repairs happen . REM sleep is what makes you feel rested when you wake up , and where the body actually rests and restores itself ( which is why you usually do n't feel rested after a night of drinking or smoking weed , they both inhibit REM sleep ) . ----------------------------------------------------------------------- These stages come in cycles . It takes roughly 90 minutes for you to go from awake into REM . The first cycle typically has a short REM period , but subsequent cycles increase the duration of REM . When we actually fall asleep , we go from stage 1 into 2 , then 3 , then 4 , but here 's where something curious happens . We then go from 4 to 3 , then 3 to 2 , then into REM . After REM , we usually return to stage 2 , then go back to 3 , 4 , then 3 , 2 , REM . We have as many cycles as we stay asleep for , when we wake up , feeling refreshed and ready or the day . ------------------------------------------------------------------------ I do n't know if that answered your question , but I hope it shed some light on the subject . Edit : formatting . Edit 2 : I 'll be here if anyone has any other questions they 'd like answered about this topic . Edit 3 : Holy crap ! Thanks for popping my gold cherry anon !

870,870,870,170,870,"This goes back to the time when U and V were actually the same letter ; so , in fact , were I and J. This is what the classical Latin alphabet looked like : A B C D E F G H I K L M N O P Q R S T V X Y Z But in handwriting , it looked a bit more like this : * a b c d e f g h j k l m n o p q r s t u x y z * Notice that in the capital letters , there is no J or U ; and in the cursive letters , no * i * or * v * . Instead , you had the following capital / cursive pairs : I*j * and V*u * . So the name "" Julius "" would , in Latin , be carved in stone as "" IVLIVS "" , but written by hand as "" * juljus * "" . These letters could be used as vowels or consonants ; so the letter "" I "" as a vowel had a sound like the "" i "" in "" sit "" , and as a consonant a sound like the "" y "" in "" yes "" ; the letter "" V "" had as a vowel a sound like the "" u "" in "" put "" , and as a consonant ... well , it was either like our "" w "" , or like our "" v "" . The smart money is on "" w "" , but there were no tape recorders in those days so we ca n't be sure . But a word like "" * uacuum * "" might have been pronounced "" wack - woom "" , and explains why our word "" vacuum "" has two Us in it . The phrase "" * uenj ujdj ujcj * "" , which we usually spell "" veni vidi vici "" ( "" I came , I saw , I conquered "" ) might have been pronounced "" wenny weedy weeky "" or "" wenny weedy wee - chee "" ( again , we ca n't be sure ) . When the Roman alphabet was used to write other languages , those other languages often had sounds that did n't exist in Latin . Sometimes they added extra letters ( for example , the letters Ð and Þ , which are still used in modern Icelandic ) , sometimes they put two or more letters together to make a new sound ( for example , our TH ) . For some languages , a new letter was created by doubling the letter V -- so VV ; or , in cursive , * uu * . Hence the name , "" double - U "" . But additionally , the letters I and V were "" split "" , to make two versions of each -- originally , one for the vowel and one for the consonant . So the letter I*j * was split to make Ii for the vowel and Jj for the consonant ( which in modern English is now pronounced differently -- in modern German it 's still pronounced like our Y ) ; V*u * was similarly split to make Uu ( vowel ) and Vv ( consonant ) . The W took on the form of the V , but we kept the name "" double - U "" . This is actually appropriate , because the English "" w "" sound is , in effect , a very short "" u "" sound . Languages like French did n't originally have this letter , because it was n't needed -- except for writing foreign words , like "" le weekend "" . But since the W now looks like two Vs , the French called it "" double - V "" . Incidentally , although you might not think it , the sounds of "" W "" and "" V "" are , phonetically , very closely related . Native English speakers can hear the difference so clearly they do n't realise how similar they are ; many Germans , however , find it very difficult , and often confuse the sounds , saying "" wiolin "" instead of "" violin "" , for example . Both sounds are also very closely related to "" U "" .","Going back to a time when U and V were in fact the same letter as well as I and J, the classical Latin alphabet featured A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, X, Y, and Z, however in handwriting it appeared a bit different with a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, x, y, z with no J or U in the capitals and no i or v in the cursive and capital/cursive pairs including I/j and V/u. The name ""Julius"" in Latin would thus be carved as ""IVLIVS"" but written as ""juljus"" as the letters could serve as both vowels and consonants, with I having a sound like ""i"" in ""sit"" and V having a sound like ""u"" in ""put"" (with the former typically becoming a ""w""). The word ""vacuum"" was likely pronounced ""wack-woom"" and the phrase ""veni vidi vici"", usually spelled ""veni vidi vici"" (I came, I saw, I conquered), may have been ""wenny weedy weeky"" or ""wenny weedy wee-chee"". As other languages adopted the Roman alphabet, letters such as Ð and Þ, as well as pairs of letters, were added to accommodate their own unique sounds, including the doubling of the letter V, forming VV or in cursive *uu*, later known as the ""double-U"". Furthermore, the letters I/j and V/u were split as one version of each was allocated for vowels and the other for consonants, giving rise to the W sound which is phonetically very close to both U and V.",4.074885368347168

The idea is to take your time and savour a few different foods , rather than gorging yourself .","The general trend at cheaper restaurants, particularly in the US, is to serve oversized portions, usually more than what can comfortably fit in a human stomach. This is done to give the impression of value for money, despite the actual food not being too expensive for the establishment. However, in more high end restaurants, this is not the case, with much smaller portions served in order to focus more on enhancing the diner's appreciation of the food, rather than overfilling them with low quality offerings. It is therefore often beneficial to take your time and savour the food in small servings, rather than stuffing yourself.",6.048628807067871
922,922,922,222,922,"In principle a submarine can stop and maintain depth , but they tend not to be very good at it . This is because , when stopped , they have to rely on trim tanks ( which can pump water in and out ) to adjust the buoyancy to keep the submarine at completely neutral buoyancy , as any small difference will cause the submarine to slowly drift up or down . This tends not to be a very accurate process , plus you are then susceptible to any upwards or downwards currents . So typically submarines will maintain a very slow speed ( 1 - 3 knots , if memory serves ) when they want to hold position , because that allows them to use their dive planes ( the little wings that are on the sides of the submarine ) . The dives planes can react quickly to changes in depth / buoyancy and can also help keep the submarine level . Source : I played some very detailed submarine simulation games recently , and this was mentioned in the ( very long ) manuals .","A submarine can technically stop and remain at a fixed depth, however submarines are not ideal for this due to the reliance on trim tanks to adjust the buoyancy, which is often not very accurate and leaves the vessel vulnerable to currents. To counter this, submarines typically travel at a very slow speed (1-3 knots) while trying to maintain position and use the dive planes on the submarine's side to quickly adjust and maintain the level. This was gleaned from researching detailed submarine simulation games.",4.018974304199219

The structure of the meat is important because it determines how easily / deeply any pathogen ( e.g. salmonella , e.coli ) can penetrate into the meat . For example chicken meat is basically a sponge . This means things like salmonella can penetrate deeply into the meat , which means you must cook the meat thoroughly in order to ensure safety ( the risk is low , but high enough to warrant this precaution ) . Beef on the other hand ( whole cuts at least ) are practically bulletproof as far as meats go . This is why you can have beef tartare , or steaks with barely a sear . The risk is comparatively much lower overall , and even if there is any harmful bacteria , it is unable to penetrate deeply into the meat - allowing you to quickly sear the meat and leave the center raw without any problems . This is also why you can easily dry age beef with few problems Ground / mince beef is technically riskier , but compared to most other meats the risk is very low ( hence tartare is on the menu ) . Fish , pork , and all wild meats can contain parasites ( with varying degrees of risk ) , which means extra care must be taken before safe consumption . Bear is so risky it is never eaten raw , while venison can be cooked to a lower temperature if handled properly beforehand . Raw fish is fine because most commercial sold fish is frozen beforehand to kill off any parasites . The same is done with pork generally , but because pork meat is still more "" spongy "" like chicken rather than "" layered "" like beef - you still have to cook thoroughly to remove the risk of bacterial contamination . Pork however can be safely dry cured when raw , as long as you use salt , sodium nitrite ( to prevent botulism ) , and the right environmental conditions ( temp / humidity ) for the cure to take place safely . Hence why you have salamis and serrano / prosciutto crudo ham . Overall - the important thing to remember is that * there is a reason * these recommendations exist * . Even though generally the risk is exaggerated through public policy ( for good reason ) , the risk is still present - so healthy adults may risk it with relative safety - but pregnant women , young children , immuno - compromised people , and the elderly should never take the risk .

988,988,988,288,988,"There are two types of abortions . Medical and surgical . Medical is quite simple and can only be done between 4 - 8 weeks safely . The doctor will give you one pill to swallow in office ( this effectively kills the fetus ) and then you take home another prescription of misoprostol . It can be taken bucally ( lined along your gums and allowed to dissolve over time ) or vaginally ( inserted with a finger or tampon but must stay laying down for 2 - 4 hours so they do not exit your vagina ) . This send the uterus into contractions like when you have your period . This will be much heavier than your normal period . You will pass huge blood clots . The next day , you will have to take those same 4 pills again to ensure that your uterus has pushed everything out . Followed by a checkup in two to three weeks to make sure you got everything out . You will still test positive on a pregnancy test for 1 - 5 weeks because they hormones take their time going back to normal . So it 's important to see a Dr for follow up . The next version is surgical which is a d & c. They will give you a medicine that is used to soften and open your cervix . They will also inject novacaine or lidocaine to minimize pain . The procedure lasts no more than 2 - 5 minutes . They enter your uterus and scrape the walls and suck it out with a vacuum like machine . It is done in one sitting and can be verified that day that the abortion is complete . They only do these on 8 - 15 weeks . Unless it 's medically required . There is typically more risk associated with this form because the scraping can cut into your uterus and cause problems further along in life . Sorry on mobile phone . Hope this is simple enough . Edit : I see some people bringing up the d & e. I was really just trying to stick to what the op asked . A simple explanation of abortions . And for me , abortions are optional meaning choice . Not like when something medically goes wrong in your pregnancy and you have to terminate . I also see people saying the pill is more dangerous than the procedure . I personally believe any medical procedure or medicine in general comes with risks . And was giving my best simplified answer .","There are two types of abortions: medical and surgical.

993,993,993,293,993,"Finally , my time to shine . Dentist here . Dentistry for the most part developed as a skilled trade . The field has resisted attempts to integrate into medicine throughout its history . Initially , dental training was spotty at best and it did n't take much for somebody to claim they were a dentist . For example , Paul Revere advertised his skills as a dentist in addition to his other trade as a silver smith . There were "" dentists "" in the 18th century that were self proclaimed but branched out into dentistry after receiving a medical education , but that was not the norm . In the US , beginning in the 1840 's , dentists began to lobby the state government ( in Alabama of all places ) to allow dentists to sit on the state medical board and license dentists to practice . This did n't really begin to be enforced with any regularity until the turn of the 20th century . Many dentists that I know do not think that the two professions should merge ( as in everyone goes to medical school and then make dentistry a residency program after getting your MD ) . The claim is that there 's so much specialized knowledge in Dentistry that it would be a waste of time to spend years on rotations through the other hospital wards when you could be studying advanced periodontics or removable or whatever else . My personal opinion is that many dentists resist the change because of a fear in the reworking of the payment structure into one more similar to the HMO model that dominates general medicine . Right now HMO practice is big in dentistry but there 's still plenty of PPO plans and cash paying patients that the compensation is good , and for the most part an insurance company is n't telling you how to practice . There 's also quite a bit of territorial feelings when it comes to dentistry . Dentists tend not to like it when they feel their "" turf "" is threatened . For examples of that , just see the whole dental therapist debate . Well this turned into a wall of text . So TL;DR : History , Ego , Fears of Rocking the boat , all work together to keep the two separate . EDIT : This Gold is a Christmas miracle ! I took a little nap and woke up to an exploded inbox , I 'm going to try and get to as many questions as possible , so bear with me .","Throughout its history, dentistry has resisted attempts to integrate into medicine, as it developed as a skilled trade with initially spotty training and people often claiming to be dentists without any formal education.
